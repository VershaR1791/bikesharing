# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis
Kate & I want to use Tableau visualization to get investors interested in their new business of starting shared bikeride services in Des Moines. We experienced the NY CitiBike Services in New York and want to share the same experience with people from Des Moines. This proposal is based on data available for NY CitiBike for the month of August. The visualization through Tableau will help answer some key business questions for the investor.
## Results
The detailed visualization story can be accessed through the following [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeSharingChallenge_16326186309130/NYCitiBikeStoryboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The following dashboard provides summary on NY CitiBike peak hours and starting/dropoff locations of bike rides in the month of August.

- The most number of rides occured on the 17th August in 2019 which was the peak of summer and a Saturday.
- The most popular destination for pickup and drop off bikes is from near the Grand Central Station and other popular destinations across Manhattan.

The following dashboard provides understandig of the time and further splicing of demographics on when the bikes are checked out.

 - The bikes are mostly checked out at midnight. This could probably be done by the staff rounding up all the unattended bikes after hours.

The following dashboard gives insights on the start time of trips based on time of the day, day of the week and further categorzation based on gender.

- The bike rides mostly start on Thursday after 5PM which is unusual since it isn't start of the weekend. Additionally the number of male riders starting rides is more than other genders.

The following dash provides additional layer of information on whether the users starting the rides were customers or subscribers. And looks like more subscribers use the CitiBike service than customers.

## Summary
Based on the data visualization some business recommendations for starting similar business in Des Moines would be -
- to have bike stations for pick up and drop off at popular locations such as train/metro stations, business parks etc.
- to build a subscription service since that seemed to have worked favorably in New York.
- hire local people to round up the bikes left unattended after hours. This will additionally generate employement.

Other visualizations that can be created to support the business proposal is-
- identifying which stations are most visited to further understand how many bikes should be made available based on popularity.
- identifying how many bikes are used often to determine how often servicing would be required.
